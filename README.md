**Bird Site Clown** is a simple Chrome extension that replaces people's NFT profile picture on the Bird Site with a unique, procedurally generated clown picture.

## Installation

### Chrome Web Store
I might put it up on Chrome Web Store eventually.

### Manual installation

Download the prebuilt release and unzip it into a folder of your choice.

Alternatively clone or download the repo, run `npm install` and then `npm run build`. The extension will be built in folder `extension`.

You can then load the extension by going to
[chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions), enabling "developer mode" (top right
corner) and clicking "Load unpacked" to select the extension folder.

## Why?
Even if we ignore the ecological impact of NFTs, they are rife with numerous scams, stolen artworks, and are generally a really bad idea. They are a silly thing.
